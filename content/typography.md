### Montserrat
<span class="display-4">Hello World. UBC CSSS. The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.</span>

<a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Google Fonts</a>

Montserrat is used for the logo text and for headers throughout the website and promotional material.
On the web, use only 1 weight per site (500 by default) to avoid loading too many fonts.
On print, use any weights as desired. You may also substitute headings with custom header fonts for certain events.
