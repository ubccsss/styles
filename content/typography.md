##### Montserrat

<span class="display-4">
Hello World. UBC CSSS. The spectacle before us was
indeed sublime.
</span>

{{< font-download Montserrat >}}

Montserrat is used for the logo text and for headers throughout the website and
promotional material. On the web, use only 1 weight per site (500 by default) to
avoid loading too many fonts. On print, use any weights as desired. You may also
substitute headings with custom header fonts for certain events.

##### Sans-serif

<span class="display-4" style="font-family:sans-serif">
Hello World. Body text.
The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.
</span>

Any sans-serif font is used for body text. Throughout the website, we use the
user's system font (i.e.: San Francisco on Apple devices, Roboto on Google
devices).
